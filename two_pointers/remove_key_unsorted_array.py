# Given an unsorted array of numbers and a target 'key', remove all instances of 'key' in-place
# and return the new length of the array.

# Input: [3, 2, 3, 6, 3, 10, 9, 3], Key=3
# Output: 4
# Explanation: The first four elements after removing every 'Key' will be [2, 6, 10, 9].

# Input: [2, 11, 2, 2, 1], Key=2
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The first two elements after removing every 'Key' will be [11, 1].
