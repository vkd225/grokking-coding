OpenSea is releasing a new feature called "What are my friends favoriting?". The feature lists a set of items that your friends have favorited and you have not already favorited, in order of most favorited to least favorited.



Part 1



To help with this, we have the following 2 APIs / helper methods. Complete the function that takes in a person and returns the items that the person's friends are favoriting.



// Returns a list of items favorited by a Person
List<Item> getFavorites(Person person);

// Returns a list of friends of a Person.
List<Person> getFriends(Person person);

// TODO: Return a list of items that a Person's friends have favorited (excluding the person's own favorites), sorted by most favorites to least favorites
List<Item> getRecommendedItems(Person person);


Part 2



Instead of your friends, what about your social circle? A social circle of a person with degree 2 is defined as the person's friends and their friends. (Customize it such that we can specify the degree, or the layers deep of how many friends)



List<Person> getSocialCircle(Person person, int degree)


Part 3



What if we wanted to sort the list weighted by the degree of your friends? Items favorited by a friend with a lower degree should appear earlier on the list.
